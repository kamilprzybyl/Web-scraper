## Databse
I am using sqlite3 python's builtin database
To open a database simply type ```sqlite3 "database name"```<br>
To see the existing tables type ```.tables"```<br>
To view the content of a table type ```select * from "table_name"```<br>
To delete the table type ```DROP table "table_name"```<br>
To quit the database type ```.quit"```<br>
  

## How it works
It simply finds and returns the speciifications of the desired product i.e. price.
<br>The data of the products is stored in a sqlite3 database
